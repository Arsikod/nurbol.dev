The semantic versioning spec outlines a standardized versioning system for software releases.
It provides a consistent way for developers to give meaning to their software releases.

Versons consist of three numbers separated by periods. Like **2.4.1**

**First number:** - MAJOR release for incompatible api changes
**Second number:** - MINOR release for adding backwards compatible functionality
**Third number:** - PATCH release for backwards compatible bug fixes
